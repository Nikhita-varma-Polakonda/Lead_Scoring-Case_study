# Lead_Scoring-Case_study

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository is part of an ongoing project for the Postgraduate Certification in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, provided by IIIT Bangalore in collaboration with UpGrad.

📚 Case Study: Lead Scoring for X Education, an online platform offering courses for learners.

🏫 Institution: IIIT Bangalore, in partnership with UpGrad.

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
A Company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.

The company requiresa model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

By focusing on improving lead conversion rates, we leveraged historical data to build a model that enables the sales team to prioritize the highest-potential leads, ultimately increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. 📈

## ✨ Key Outcomes:
- Achieved an impressive 80%+ lead conversion rate, a significant jump from the usual 30%. 📊
- Enabled the sales team to focus on high-quality leads, saving time and resources while closing more deals. 💼
- Applied machine learning techniques for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. 🤖

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) 🐍
- Advanced feature selection and hyperparameter tuning ⚙️
- Model evaluation techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability 🔍
